Key Points about Interfaces:
No Implementation: An interface only declares the method signatures or properties, and itâ€™s up to the class or struct that implements the interface to provide the actual behavior (implementation).

Multiple Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, which provides a form of multiple inheritance (something C# does not support with classes).

Polymorphism: Interfaces allow for polymorphism, meaning different types can be treated the same way if they implement the same interface, even if they are unrelated in terms of class hierarchy.
